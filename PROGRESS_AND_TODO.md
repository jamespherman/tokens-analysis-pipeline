# Project Progress and To-Do List

## Completed

- [x] Phase 0: Project Initialization & Documentation
- [x] Phase 1: Manifest Augmentation
- [x] Phase 3.B: Neuron Screening & Selection (`screen_da_neurons.m`, `screen_sc_neurons.m`)
- [x] Phase 3.C: Diagnostic Plot Generation (`generate_neuron_summary_pdf.m`)
- [x] Phase 3.D: Core Data Preparation (`prepare_core_data.m`)
- [x] Phase 4.A: Analysis Pipeline (`run_tokens_analysis.m`)
- [x] Phase 4.B: Baseline vs. Post-Event Analysis (`analyze_baseline_comparison.m`)
- [x] Phase 4.C: Between-Condition ROC Analysis (`analyze_roc_comparison.m`)
- [x] Phase 4.D: N-way ANOVA Analysis (`analyze_anova.m`)
- [x] Phase 5.A: Plotting for Baseline Comparison (`plot_baseline_comparison.m`)
- [x] Phase 5.B: Plotting for ROC Comparison (`plot_roc_comparison.m`)
- [x] Phase 6.A: Results Aggregation (`aggregate_analysis_results.m`)
- [x] Phase 6.B: Aggregated Plotting Pipeline (`run_plotting_pipeline.m`, `plot_aggregated_roc_comparison.m`, `plot_aggregated_anova.m`)
- [x] Phase 6: Optimize aggregation script to eliminate redundant file loading.
- [x] Integrate `define_analysis_plan.m` into the main pipeline. **(Note: This file was made obsolete and removed in favor of a more robust dynamic discovery design.)**
- [x] Phase 7: Implement aggregation and plotting for baseline vs. post-event analysis.
- [x] For consistency, add an `is_av_only` flag to the `anova_plan` within `define_task_conditions.m`, similar to the `roc_plan` and `baseline_plan`. This makes the entire analysis plan more uniform and easier to manage programmatically.
- [x] The `define_task_conditions.m` function now generates a `reward_distributions.pdf` for each session. This side effect is now managed by saving the artifact to the `data/reprocessed` directory.
- [x] Develop a comprehensive test suite for all analysis and plotting functions. **(Note: A master test script `run_all_tests.m` has been created to execute a series of verification functions for the main components of the pipeline.)**

## Agent-Suggested Improvements
- The project would benefit from a comprehensive test suite to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the analysis and plotting functions. This would involve creating a suite of tests that cover the core functionality of each script, including edge cases and known failure modes. This would also help to prevent regressions as the codebase evolves.
