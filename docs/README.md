# Project Documentation

This directory contains documentation relevant to the `tokens-analysis-pipeline`.

## /preprocessing_docs

This subdirectory contains documentation inherited from the upstream `neuro-preprocessing-pipeline`. These documents describe how the raw neural and behavioral data were processed into the final `session_data.mat` files that this analysis pipeline uses as input. This includes critical information on:

* The overall preprocessing workflow.
* The exact structure and contents of the `session_data.mat` file.
* Guidance on how to correctly handle the preprocessed data (e.g., filtering for high-quality units).
