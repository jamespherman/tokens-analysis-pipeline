# Guide for the Data Analyst

This document provides essential information for analyzing the preprocessed data in this project. The final output of the pipeline is a `session_data.mat` file for each recording session, but this file does not contain all the necessary information for a complete analysis.

## Session Metadata: `config/session_manifest.csv`

The primary source of metadata for each session is the `config/session_manifest.csv` file. This file is the control center for the entire preprocessing pipeline. Each row in this file corresponds to a unique recording from a single probe.

To begin an analysis, you should always start by consulting the manifest to identify the sessions of interest and retrieve their associated metadata.

### Manifest Columns

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `unique_id` | A unique identifier for a single recording from a single probe, constructed as `{monkey}_{date}_{brain_area}`. This ID is used to name all processed data directories and files. |
| `session_group_id` | An identifier that links multiple recordings from the same day and animal (e.g., from two different probes). This is used to group related `unique_id` entries. |
| `monkey` | The name of the subject monkey (e.g., `Feynman`, `Newton`). |
| `date` | The date of the recording session in `MM_DD_YYYY` format. |
| `experiment_pc_name` | The name of the PC that ran the behavioral task (e.g., `pldaps2`). This is used to find the correct PLDAPS data file. |
| `probe_type` | The type of neural probe used for the recording (e.g., `nnVector`, `vProbe`). |
| `brain_area` | The targeted brain region for this specific recording (e.g., `SNc`, `SC`). |
| `channel_numbers` | The range of channel numbers on the headstage that correspond to this probe (e.g., `1:32`). |
| `channel_ordering` | A string representing the physical layout and ordering of channels on the probe. This is used by Kilosort for spike sorting. |
| `raw_filename_base` | The base name of the raw neural data files (e.g., `feynman_08052025_01`). The pipeline expects to find `.nev` and `.ns` files with this base name. |
| `dat_status` | The status of the `.dat` file conversion step. |
| `behavior_status` | The status of the behavioral data preparation step (`prep.prepare_behavioral_data`). |
| `kilosort_status` | The status of the Kilosort spike sorting step. |
| `waveform_status` | The status of the mean waveform extraction step. |
| `consolidation_status` | The status of the final data consolidation step (`consolidate.consolidate_data`). |
| `notes` | A free-text field for any relevant notes about the session, often including the names of the behavioral tasks that were run. |

## Locating Session Data Files

All processed data, including the final `_session_data.mat` file, is stored in a structured directory within your OneDrive. The root for all processed data is a folder named `Neuronal Data Analysis`. Inside this folder, there is a separate directory for each session, named with the session's `unique_id`.

The full path to a session's data folder is:
`{Your_OneDrive_Path}/Neuronal Data Analysis/{unique_id}/`

The pipeline includes a helper function, `utils.findOneDrive.m`, to get the root path of your OneDrive folder programmatically. You can combine this with a `unique_id` from the manifest to construct the full path to the data file you want to analyze.

Example (in MATLAB):
```matlab
% 1. Choose a unique_id from the session_manifest.csv
session_id = 'Feynman_08_12_2025_SNc';

% 2. Get the root of your OneDrive directory
oneDrivePath = utils.findOneDrive();

% 3. Construct the path to the session's data folder
sessionDataFolder = fullfile(oneDrivePath, 'Neuronal Data Analysis', session_id);

% 4. Construct the full path to the session_data.mat file
sessionDataFile = fullfile(sessionDataFolder, [session_id, '_session_data.mat']);

% 5. Check if the file exists and load it
if isfile(sessionDataFile)
    fprintf('Loading data from: %s\n', sessionDataFile);
    load(sessionDataFile);
else
    fprintf('Error: Could not find the data file at: %s\n', sessionDataFile);
end
```

## Pipeline Parameters: `config/pipeline_config.m`

Global parameters that apply to the entire preprocessing pipeline are defined in the `config/pipeline_config.m` file. This includes key values such as:

*   **`samplingRate`**: The sampling rate of the neural data (e.g., 30000 Hz).
*   **`n_channels_in_dat`**: The number of channels in the processed `.dat` file.

Refer to this file to understand the basic parameters used during data processing.

## Filtering for High-Quality Neurons

The `session_data.spikes` structure contains all the spike data from Kilosort. To ensure you are analyzing high-quality, well-isolated single neurons, you must filter the units based on the information in the `spikes.cluster_info` table.

The most important column for this purpose is `group`. This column contains the quality label assigned during the manual curation step in Phy. You should typically filter for units where `group` is equal to `'good'`. Other labels, such as `'mua'` (multi-unit activity) or `'noise'`, should usually be excluded from single-neuron analysis.

Example (in MATLAB):
```matlab
% Load your session_data.mat file
load('Feynman_08_12_2025_SNc_session_data.mat');

% Find the indices of 'good' clusters
good_cluster_indices = find(strcmp(session_data.spikes.cluster_info.group, 'good'));

% Get the cluster IDs for the 'good' clusters
good_cluster_ids = session_data.spikes.cluster_info.cluster_id(good_cluster_indices);

% Filter spike times to include only 'good' clusters
good_spikes_mask = ismember(session_data.spikes.clusters, good_cluster_ids);
good_spike_times = session_data.spikes.times(good_spikes_mask);
```

## Linking to Behavioral Task Data

The `session_manifest.csv` file provides the link between a `session_data.mat` file and the specific behavioral task that was performed. The `notes` and `experiment_pc_name` columns can be used to identify the task.

Once you have identified the task, you can find a detailed data dictionary for that task's specific variables in the `/docs/task_data_dictionaries/` directory. These dictionaries explain the meaning of the task-specific columns found in the `session_data.trialInfo` table. This is crucial for understanding the behavioral data associated with the neural recordings.
